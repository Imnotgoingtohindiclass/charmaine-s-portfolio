            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my portfolio! As you may have already guessed, my is Charmaine and I am a student 
                currently studying at School of Science and Technology, Singapore (SST). I was previously 
                studying at Tampines Primary School (TPPS) where I was a prefect there, and joined their 
                floorball CCA, whilst in secondary school, I joined the Show Choir and Dance CCA (the dance 
                side as we practice separately). Some fun facts about me is that I LOVE food, dancing, and 
                reading occasionally when I have the time.
